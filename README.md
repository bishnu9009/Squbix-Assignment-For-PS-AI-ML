# Squbix-Assignment-For-PS-AI-ML

### General Information about the Repository
- This repository contain the Jupyter Notebook files for Assignment given by Squbix. The Assignment is based on AI/ML techniques and  contain machine learning models based on two popular datasets 'Boston Housing Prices' and 'California Housing Prices'. The project introduces an web based Application which can be used to find pricing of house.
- I have created two separate Notebooks, one for 'California Housing Price' dataset and other for 'Boston Housing Price' dataset.
- Running of the files requires active internet connection to download datasets and the required libraries. However if internet connection is not available the datasets are provided in .csv format in the repo as well.
- Both the notebooks require Jupyter/Anadonda installation as a prerequisite.
- Please DO run the notebook cells sequentially to not get any errors.
- The reports are also given in the repo, There are two reports for the two different notebooks.
